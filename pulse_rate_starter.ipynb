    "Dataset contains 12 persons' ppg and three dimensions(x, y, z) accelerometer signal values.\n",
    "All subjects are male and they are between 18-35 years old.\n",
    "The data collected by wearing a wrist device while resting(30 sec) walking, running(4 min) and during a brief cooldown(30 sec) on a treadmill. All signals were sampled at 125 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset also includes reference heart rate values calculated from the ECG signal for using as ground-truth.\n",

    "**Short comings:** All of the data collected from only male subjects and age distribution is too restricted. This may not does not reflect the population. Also we don't know about skin color of the subjects. Dark and light skin may differ.\n",
    "For better estimation, dataset must contain diversity."

    "**Phisiology** of behind this algorithm is movement of the blood in the vessels. During systole, capillaries fill with blood and during diastole, blood inside the capillaries decreases. The PPG sensor uses a green light. This light absorbed by the RBC. The changes in the amount of reflected light is detected by the sensor. By this data, we understand the phase of the heart cycle.\n",

    "**The algorithm** is composed of several functions. Calculates heart rate without artefacts.\n",
    "We load ppg and acc signal values from files, bandpass filtering on raw signals between 40 and 240 BPM and apply the Fourier transform. This cut-off values determined by physiologic heart rates. The algorithm computes largest FFT coefficient, pick the PPG frequency with this as the best estimate. \n",
    "After finding predicted frequency, for understanding that this value not comes from movement artefacts, compare this value with acc signals frequency. If difference equals 0, the algorithm tests the PPG frequency with the second largest FFT coefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The algorithm outputs** the array of mean absolute errors calculated between predicted vs ground-truth heart rate array and array of confidence score. The confidence includes how much energy in the frequency spectrum is concentrated near the pulse rate estimate. The confidence represents the confidence that the estimated pulse rate represents a correct estimated pulse rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insightful caveats and failure-modes of the algorithm:** The algorithm is based on estimation of strong frequency spectral in the ppg signals relative to the entire frequency spectral of the ppg signals. The wearer's motion can produce strong signals which can be confused for the pulse rate resulting in algorithm failure."
